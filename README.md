This repository hosts code for converting the original ConvMixer [^1] (PyTorch) models to TensorFlow. In this repo we convert these 3 ConvMixer models to TensorFlow SavedModels:

| Model Name | resolution | acc@1 | #params | File Size | TensorFlow Model |
|------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|----------:|:--------------:|

ConvMixer is a simple model, proposed in the paper "Patches Are All You Need?" [^2] for image classification pre-trained on ImageNet-1K. ConvMixer uses only standard convolutions to achieve the mixing steps. Despite it's simplicity it outperforms ViT and MLP-Mixer. Using the [`conversion.ipynb`](conversion.ipynb) notebook, one should be able to take a model from the pre-trained models and convert that to TensorFlow and use that with TensorFlow Hub and Keras.

The original model classes and weights were converted using the `onnx-tf` tool [^3].

## About the Notebooks

### [`conversion.ipynb`](conversion.ipynb)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Rishit-dagli/ConvMixer-torch2tf/blob/main/conversion.ipynb)
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Rishit-dagli/ConvMixer-torch2tf/HEAD?labpath=conversion.ipynb)

This notebook demonstrates how the models were converted to TensorFlow SavedModel and uses `onnx-tf` [^3] tool to do so. This notebook loads the ConvMixer model using timm (PyTorch Image Models) [^4] modifying some of the code to allow doing so as shown in the [`timm_convmixer.py`](timm_convmixer.py) file in this repo.

### [`classification.ipynb`](classification.ipynb)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Rishit-dagli/ConvMixer-torch2tf/blob/main/classification.ipynb)
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Rishit-dagli/ConvMixer-torch2tf/HEAD?labpath=classification.ipynb)

This noteboook demonstrates how to load a ConvMixer Model varaint and run image classification using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub [^5]. This notebook will soon be updated to fetch models from tfhub.dev. These models can be used in the exact same manner with TensorFlow Keras too.
